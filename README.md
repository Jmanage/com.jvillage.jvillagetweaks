JVillage CiviCRM Tweaks
=======================

Also includes the old "civicrm_custom_code" hacks from Pogstone, and any
CiviCRM core PHP or TPL that may have been overriden.

When we upgrade CiviCRM core, it's important to diff against the original
to make sure we integrate bug/security fixes in overriden files.
